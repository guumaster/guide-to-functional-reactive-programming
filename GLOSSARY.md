# Procedural programming
 a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of the procedure call. Procedures, also known as routines, subroutines, methods, or functions that simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out.

# Functional programming
Is a programming paradigm, a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs, that treats computation as the evaluation of functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions.

# Reactive programming
 a programming paradigm oriented around data flows and the propagation of change. This means that it should be possible to express static or dynamic data flows with ease in the programming languages used, and that the underlying execution model will automatically propagate changes through the data flow.

# Functional Reactive Programming
Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) is a programming paradigm for reactive programming using the building blocks of functional programming. It integrates time flow and compositional events into functional programming. This provides an elegant way to express computation in domains such as interactive animations, robotics, computer vision, user interfaces, and simulation.

# First-class functions
A programming language is said to have first-class functions if it treats functions as first-class citizens. Specifically, this means the language supports passing functions as arguments to other functions, returning them as the values from other functions, and assigning them to variables or storing them in data structures. First-class functions are a necessity for the functional programming style, in which the use of higher-order functions is a standard practice.

# Higher-order functions
a function that eithers takes one or more functions as an input or outputs a function

# Pure functions
Functions (or expressions) have no side effects. In JavaScript, functions that don't have dependencies from outer scopes.
