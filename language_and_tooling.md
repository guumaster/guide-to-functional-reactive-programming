## Language and tooling

### Which language to use?

I'll use JavaScript. Why? Simply because it's everywhere. It has transcended the browser for a long time now. Plus, as we'll see, it comply with all the rules of a functional programming language.

Also, I'm lazy and I don't want to learn another language. Sure, there may be a better place to start in the functional programming world, but won't be too much of use on my day to day coding.

### What would we be using then?

These are the main tooling that we are going to use through all the articles:

* JavaScript language, of course
* [NodeJs](http://nodejs.com)
* [LoDash library](https://lodash.com/) (an improved fork of Underscore.js)
* [RxJs - Reactive Extensions](http://reactive-extensions.github.io/RxJS/)


#### Javascript

This language is very easy to learn, but I think is hard to master. It has a long history and is getting more and more attention everyday. With all the attention, the language is evolving very fast, getting more robust, versatile and spread.

#### NodeJs

As prove of the JavaScript spreading, there it is NodeJs. A way of running JS in the server that opened a wide range of new utilities. With NodeJs the development lifecycle becomes really fast. Plus, you gain the benefits of writing all your code in a single language.

#### LoDash / Underscore

The first contact I had with functional programming was when I started  to learn underscore.js. This library is very powerful and helpful in my daily coding. I tend to use it a lot. I prefer LoDash because of the more frequent updates and [several other reasons](http://kitcambridge.be/blog/say-hello-to-lo-dash/).

#### Reactive Extensions

There are not too many JS tools for Reactive Programming. I've found RxJS in a [Netflix talk on youtube] that really got my attention. I've chosen this one because of the team that is behind it. They also mantains the same library in several other languages.
