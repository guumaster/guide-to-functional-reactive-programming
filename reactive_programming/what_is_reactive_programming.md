## What is Reactive Programming

The concept of Reactive Programming isn't new, it has been around for some years now. But the definitions that you can easily find on the internet is maybe too theoretical and/or academic.

Reactive Programming is a way of coding with asynchronous data streams.


## Why to use it

Reactive Programming raise the level of abstraction of your code so you can focus on the business logic, rather than having to constantly fiddle with a large amount of implementation detail.

Code in FRP tends to be more concise.
